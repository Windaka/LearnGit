Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie (Indonesian: [baxaˈrudːin ˈjusuf haˈbibi] 
(About this soundlisten); 25 June 1936 – 11 September 2019) 
was an Indonesian engineer and politician who was the third president of Indonesia from 1998 to 1999. 
Less than three months after his inauguration as the seventh vice president in March 1998, 
he succeeded Suharto who resigned after 31 years in office. 
His presidency is seen as a landmark and transition to the Reformation era. Upon becoming president, 
he liberalized Indonesia's press and political party laws, 
and held an early democratic election three years sooner than scheduled, which resulted in the end of his presidency. 
His 517-day presidency and 71-day vice presidency are the shortest in the country's history.
